## Detailed Remediation Plans

### TD-001: Missing JSDoc Comments
**Ease**: 2 | **Impact**: 游리 Medium | **Risk**: 游릭 Low

#### Overview
Many public methods lack JSDoc documentation, making the codebase harder to understand and maintain.

#### Explanation
The codebase has inconsistent documentation. While some modules have partial JSDoc comments, many critical methods lack proper documentation. This creates onboarding friction and maintenance challenges.

#### Requirements
- JSDoc style guide compliance
- Document all public methods
- Include parameter types and return values

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add JSDoc comments to all AudioHandler public methods
2. Document UI module public interface
3. Add parameter and return type documentation
4. Document event bus patterns and event types
5. Add usage examples for complex methods

#### Testing
- Verify JSDoc generation works correctly
- Review documentation completeness with team
- Ensure examples in documentation are accurate

### TD-002: Console Logging in Production
**Ease**: 1 | **Impact**: 游리 Medium | **Risk**: 游릭 Low

#### Overview
24 console.log/error statements exist throughout the codebase, potentially exposing debug information in production.

#### Explanation
Debug logging is scattered across modules without a proper logging strategy. This can leak sensitive information and clutters browser console in production.

#### Requirements
- Implement proper logging utility
- Environment-based log levels
- Remove or replace existing console statements

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create `js/logger.js` utility with log levels
2. Replace all console.log statements with logger utility
3. Add environment detection for log level control
4. Keep only essential error logging for production
5. Update .gitignore to exclude debug logs

#### Testing
- Verify no console.log statements remain in production build
- Test logger utility across different environments
- Ensure error logging still captures critical issues

---

### TD-003: UI Direct Method Access
**Ease**: 3 | **Impact**: 游댮 High | **Risk**: 游리 Medium

#### Overview
AudioHandler directly calls UI methods (e.g., `this.ui.updateTimer`, `this.ui.hideSpinner`), violating the event-driven architecture.

#### Explanation
This creates tight coupling between AudioHandler and UI modules, making testing difficult and breaking the established event-driven pattern. Found in methods like `startTimer()`, `cleanup()`, and `sendToAzureAPI()`.

#### Requirements
- Remove all direct UI method calls from AudioHandler
- Implement event-driven communication for timer updates
- Maintain current functionality without breaking changes

#### Implementation Steps
1. Define new events in APP_EVENTS for timer updates and spinner control
2. Update AudioHandler to emit events instead of calling UI methods directly
3. Add event listeners in UI module for timer and spinner events
4. Update RecordingStateMachine to emit UI events where needed
5. Remove UI parameter from AudioHandler constructor

#### Testing
- Verify all UI updates work through event bus
- Test timer functionality remains accurate
- Ensure spinner state management works correctly
- Run existing tests to verify no regression

---

### TD-004: Magic Values in Timer Logic
**Ease**: 2 | **Impact**: 游리 Medium | **Risk**: 游릭 Low

#### Overview
Hard-coded values like timer intervals (1000ms), display formats, and delays are scattered throughout the code.

#### Explanation
Found in `startTimer()` method and other locations. Magic numbers make the code less maintainable and harder to configure.

#### Requirements
- Extract all magic values to constants
- Use descriptive constant names
- Centralize timing configurations

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add timer-related constants to `constants.js`
2. Replace hard-coded intervals with named constants
3. Extract display format strings to constants
4. Update gracefulStop delay parameter to use constant
5. Document timing rationale in comments

#### Testing
- Verify timer accuracy after changes
- Test all timing-dependent functionality
- Ensure constants are used consistently

---

### TD-005: Incomplete Test Coverage
**Ease**: 4 | **Impact**: 游댮 High | **Risk**: 游리 Medium

#### Overview
Critical gaps in test coverage for UI event handling, settings persistence, and error scenarios.

#### Explanation
Current tests cover basic state machine and visualization logic but miss crucial integration scenarios and error handling paths. This creates risk for production issues.

#### Requirements
- Achieve >80% test coverage for critical paths
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies properly

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add tests for UI event bus interactions
2. Create tests for settings validation and persistence
3. Add error scenario tests for permission manager
4. Test Azure API error handling paths
5. Add integration tests for complete recording flow
6. Test visualization event handling edge cases

#### Testing
- Run coverage reports to verify improvement
- Test all error scenarios manually
- Verify mocks accurately represent real dependencies

---

### TD-006: Settings Direct DOM Queries
**Ease**: 2 | **Impact**: 游리 Medium | **Risk**: 游릭 Low

#### Overview
Settings module performs direct DOM queries in methods like `loadSettingsToForm()` instead of using cached references.

#### Explanation
This pattern is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase and creates potential performance issues and null reference risks.

#### Requirements
- Cache all DOM references in constructor
- Remove direct getElementById calls from methods
- Maintain error handling for missing elements

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add missing DOM element references to Settings constructor
2. Replace getElementById calls with cached references
3. Add null checks for optional elements
4. Update error handling for missing DOM elements
5. Ensure consistent pattern across all modules

#### Testing
- Verify settings functionality works with cached references
- Test error handling when DOM elements are missing
- Ensure no performance regression

---

### TD-007: Commented Legacy Code
**Ease**: 1 | **Impact**: 游릭 Low | **Risk**: 游릭 Low

#### Overview
Dead code comments like `// document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('settingsUpdated'));` should be removed.

#### Explanation
Legacy commented code creates confusion and clutters the codebase. These should be removed as they're no longer needed.

#### Requirements
- Remove all commented legacy code
- Keep only explanatory comments
- Update code comments for accuracy

#### Implementation Steps
1. Identify all commented legacy code
2. Verify code is truly obsolete
3. Remove unnecessary commented code
4. Update remaining comments for accuracy
5. Add explanatory comments where needed

#### Testing

### TD-008: Error Handling Inconsistency
**Ease**: 3 | **Impact**: 游댮 High | **Risk**: 游리 Medium

#### Overview
Inconsistent error handling patterns across modules create unpredictable user experience and debugging challenges.

#### Explanation
Some modules use try-catch blocks, others emit events, and some directly show errors. This inconsistency makes error tracking and user feedback unpredictable.

#### Requirements
- Standardize error handling pattern
- Ensure all errors emit appropriate events
- Provide consistent user feedback

#### Implementation Steps
1. Define standard error handling pattern
2. Update all modules to use consistent error handling
3. Ensure errors emit appropriate events via event bus
4. Standardize error message formatting
5. Add error logging for debugging

#### Testing
- Test error scenarios across all modules
- Verify consistent user feedback for errors
- Ensure error events are emitted correctly

### TD-009: Large Method Complexity
**Ease**: 3 | **Impact**: 游리 Medium | **Risk**: 游리 Medium

#### Overview
Methods like `setupEventBusListeners()` and `startRecordingFlow()` are too large and handle multiple responsibilities.

#### Explanation
These methods violate the single responsibility principle and are difficult to test and maintain. They should be broken into smaller, focused methods.

#### Requirements
- Split large methods into smaller functions
- Ensure each method has single responsibility
- Maintain readability and testability

#### Implementation Steps
1. Identify methods exceeding 20-30 lines
2. Extract logical groups into separate methods
