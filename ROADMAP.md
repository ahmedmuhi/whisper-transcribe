# Whisper-Transcribe Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** July 6, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines a phased, actionable roadmap to evolve the Whisper-Transcribe codebase. Each phase targets a distinct improvement area—code quality, testing, documentation, performance/UX, and DevOps—to boost maintainability, reliability, and developer velocity.

## Phase 1 – Code Quality & Architecture
**Objective:** Eliminate technical debt, enforce clean architecture, and simplify complex code paths.

- **TD-001**: Add comprehensive JSDoc to all public methods across modules (AudioHandler, UI, API client, etc.)
- **TD-002**: Implement a lightweight `logger` utility (env-aware log levels) and replace all `console.*` calls
- **TD-003**: Remove direct UI method calls from non-UI modules—define and emit new events (`TIMER_TICK`, `SPINNER_SHOW`, `SPINNER_HIDE`) in `APP_EVENTS`
- **TD-009**: Refactor large methods (≥ 30 LOC) into single-purpose helpers or utility functions
- **YAGNI Audit**: Identify and safely remove dead code, commented-out blocks, and duplicate logic

**Deliverables:**
- Updated `js/constants.js` with new event definitions
- `js/logger.js` utility module
- Refactored `AudioHandler`, `RecordingStateMachine`, and other modules with JSDoc and event-based communication

---

## Phase 2 – Testing & Quality Gates
**Objective:** Strengthen automated test coverage, introduce E2E smoke tests, and enforce CI quality gates.

- **TD-005**: Expand unit test coverage to ≥ 80% for core flows (record→pause→stop→transcribe, settings edge cases)
- **E2E Smoke Tests**: Automate a headless browser scenario (e.g. Playwright) to record mock audio, mock Azure response, and verify UI output
- **CI Pipeline**: Configure GitHub Actions or similar to run lint, type checks, unit tests, coverage reports, and block merges on regressions
- **Mutation Testing**: Integrate Stryker or similar on key modules (state machine, API client) to validate test effectiveness

**Deliverables:**
- New integration/E2E test suite
- CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Coverage badge in `README.md`

---

## Phase 3 – Documentation & Onboarding
**Objective:** Provide clear architecture docs, API references, and a low-friction onboarding guide.

- **TD-010**: Draft `ARCHITECTURE.md`—system overview, module boundaries, event-bus patterns, sequence diagrams for key flows
- **JSDoc Site**: Generate HTML docs from code comments and link in `README.md`
- **Getting Started**: Create `GETTING_STARTED.md`—quickstart instructions, local dev setup, test commands
- **Non-technical Overview**: Add a “How It Works” section for UX/infra stakeholders

**Deliverables:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`
- Updated `README.md` with doc links
- Generated JSDoc artifacts under `/docs`

---

## Phase 4 – Performance & UX
**Objective:** Optimize runtime performance, accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.

- **Web Worker**: Offload audio processing and transcription calls to a dedicated Worker thread
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamically import heavy modules (Azure client, visualization) only when needed
- **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts for record/pause/stop
- **Responsive UI**: Improve canvas and controls for mobile, low-power mode detection

**Deliverables:**
- `src/workers/transcript-worker.js`
- Updated `js/ui.js` with accessibility attributes
- Performance benchmarks/logging to validate improvements

---

## Phase 5 – DevOps & Release
**Objective:** Automate versioning, release management, and runtime monitoring.

- **Semantic Release**: Configure `semantic-release` for automated changelog, tagging, and npm publishing
- **Build Step**: Introduce bundler (esbuild/Vite) for optimized static output and tree-shaking
- **Error Reporting**: Integrate Sentry or Azure Application Insights for real-time error tracking
- **Release Dashboard**: Define metrics (coverage, performance, error rate) and expose status in a dashboard or `README.md`

**Deliverables:**
- `.releaserc` and CI release workflow
- Build scripts in `package.json`
- Monitoring integration and startup instrumentation

---

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize Phase 1 items and break them into individual issues or PRs
2. Assign owners and schedule checkpoints in project board
3. Implement changes incrementally—run tests after each PR
4. Iterate phases in order, adjusting scope based on team feedback and metrics

*This roadmap is intended to be a living document—update phases, tasks, and timelines as the project evolves.*
