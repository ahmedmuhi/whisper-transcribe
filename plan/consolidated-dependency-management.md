# Comprehensive Dependency Management Plan

This consolidated plan combines dependency auditing and elimination strategies using modern tooling (Knip) to maintain a clean, secure, and efficient dependency tree.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Configuration
- Knip 5.61.3+ already installed and configured
- `knip.json` configuration file present
- ES module environment with modern JavaScript patterns
- Current dependencies need systematic review

### Objectives
1. Eliminate unused dependencies from package.json
2. Detect missing dependencies referenced in code
3. Establish ongoing maintenance workflows
4. Prevent dependency bloat through automation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Audit
```bash
# Generate comprehensive dependency report
npm run deps:check:prod      # Check production dependencies
npx knip --reporter json > metrics/dependency-audit.json
npx knip --include duplicates,unlisted,unresolved
```

### Phase 2: Safe Cleanup Process
1. **Review Generated Reports**
   - Analyze unused dependencies in `/metrics/dependency-audit.json`
   - Verify no false positives (dynamic imports, tooling deps)
   - Check for development vs production dependency misclassification

2. **Manual Removal Process**
   - Remove obviously unused packages first
   - Test after each removal to ensure no breakage
   - Document any edge cases requiring ignore rules

3. **Update Ignore Configuration**
   ```json
   // knip.json - Example ignore patterns
   {
     "ignore": [
       "vitest",           // Test runner
       "@vitest/ui",       // Development tooling
       "happy-dom"         // Test environment
     ]
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Automation Integration
```json
// package.json scripts
{
  "deps:audit": "knip --reporter json > metrics/dependency-audit.json",
  "deps:check": "knip",
  "deps:check:prod": "knip --production",
  "deps:unused": "knip --include unused",
  "deps:missing": "knip --include unresolved"
}
```

### Phase 4: CI Integration
- Add dependency checks to pre-push hooks
- Include in GitHub Actions workflow
- Generate reports for pull request review

## Safety Measures

### False Positive Handling
- Maintain ignore lists for known edge cases
- Document rationale for each ignored dependency
- Regular review of ignore lists to prevent staleness

### Rollback Strategy
- Track all dependency changes in git
- Test thoroughly after bulk removals
- Keep backup package.json during major cleanups

### Validation Process
1. Run full test suite after dependency changes
2. Verify application functionality in development
3. Check for runtime errors in browser console
4. Validate build process remains intact

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- Reduced bundle size from eliminated unused dependencies
- Faster npm install times
- Cleaner dependency tree
- Better security posture (fewer attack vectors)

### Long-term Benefits
- Automated dependency hygiene
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Reduced technical debt
- Improved development experience

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- Review dependency audit reports
- Check for new unused dependencies

### Monthly  
- Full dependency audit and cleanup
- Update ignore lists if needed
- Review security advisories

### Quarterly
- Comprehensive dependency update cycle
- Re-evaluate ignored dependencies
- Update tooling and processes

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 20%+ reduction in total dependency count
- [ ] Zero false positive removals
- [ ] Automated audit process established
- [ ] CI integration functioning
- [ ] Documentation updated

This consolidated approach ensures systematic, safe dependency management while preventing future bloat through automation and regular maintenance.
