# Comprehensive Test Coverage Strategy

This consolidated plan addresses test coverage expansion, threshold management, and quality assurance for the whisper-transcribe project.

## Current Coverage Status

### Baseline Metrics
- Statements: ~71% (Target: 80%+)
- Branches: ~55% (Target: 80%+)
- Functions: ~64% (Target: 80%+)
- Lines: ~70% (Target: 80%+)

### Test Suite Inventory
- 4 primary test suites with 14 core tests
- Strong coverage for state machine logic
- Gap areas: UI interactions, error scenarios, integration paths

## Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: Critical Gap Analysis
1. **UI Event Handling Coverage**
   - Test all event bus interactions
   - UI component event handling
   - Settings modal interactions
   - Theme switching functionality

2. **Error Scenario Coverage**
   - Permission manager error paths
   - API client failure scenarios
   - Network timeout handling
   - Invalid configuration handling

3. **Integration Test Coverage**
   - Complete recording workflow
   - Settings persistence and validation
   - Visualization lifecycle management

### Phase 2: Threshold Management Strategy

#### Realistic Threshold Setting
```javascript
// jest.config.js - Achievable thresholds
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 85,  // Up from current 71%
    branches: 80,    // Up from current 55%
    functions: 70,   // Maintain current 64%+
    lines: 85        // Up from current 70%
  }
}
```

#### Per-Module Thresholds
- **Core modules** (80%+ all metrics): audio-handler.js, recording-state-machine.js
- **API modules** (75%+ coverage): api-client.js, settings.js
- **Utility modules** (70%+ coverage): logger.js, constants.js

### Phase 3: Test Implementation Priorities

#### High Priority (Critical Business Logic)
1. **Audio Handler Integration Tests**
   - MediaRecorder lifecycle management
   - Stream handling and cleanup
   - Error recovery scenarios

2. **API Client Comprehensive Testing**
   - All transcription model configurations
   - Error response handling
   - Network timeout scenarios
   - Configuration validation

3. **Settings Persistence Testing**
   - localStorage validation
   - Configuration migration
   - Invalid data handling

#### Medium Priority (User Experience)
1. **UI Event Testing**
   - Button state management
   - Modal interactions
   - Theme persistence
   - Status message display

2. **Permission Manager Edge Cases**
   - Browser permission variations
   - Permission revocation handling
   - Microphone access recovery

#### Lower Priority (Edge Cases)
1. **Visualization Controller**
   - Canvas rendering edge cases
   - Performance under stress
   - Memory cleanup validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Development Approach
```javascript
// Example comprehensive test structure
describe('AudioHandler Integration', () => {
  describe('Recording Lifecycle', () => {
    test('handles complete recording flow');
    test('recovers from MediaRecorder errors');
    test('cleans up resources on cancellation');
  });
  
  describe('Error Scenarios', () => {
    test('handles microphone access denial');
    test('recovers from stream interruption');
    test('manages browser compatibility issues');
  });
});
```

### Mocking Strategy
- **DOM APIs**: Use jsdom with careful mocking
- **MediaRecorder**: Mock with realistic event firing
- **Azure API**: Mock with various response scenarios
- **LocalStorage**: Mock with validation testing

### Coverage Monitoring
```bash
# Regular coverage commands
npm run test:coverage          # Generate full coverage report
npm run test:coverage:watch    # Development mode with live updates
npm run test:ui               # Interactive test development
```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Validation
- All new code must include corresponding tests
- Coverage cannot decrease from baseline
- Critical paths must have >90% coverage

### CI/CD Integration
- Coverage reports generated on every PR
- Threshold enforcement prevents regression
- Performance impact monitoring

### Review Process
- Test quality review in code reviews
- Coverage impact assessment
- Integration test validation

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets (6-month goals)
- [ ] Statements: 85%+ (from 71%)
- [ ] Branches: 80%+ (from 55%)
- [ ] Functions: 70%+ (maintain 64%+)
- [ ] Lines: 85%+ (from 70%)

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] Zero critical paths untested
- [ ] 100% error scenario coverage for core flows
- [ ] Integration test coverage for complete user workflows
- [ ] Reduced bug reports from production

### Process Metrics
- [ ] Test development integrated into feature workflow
- [ ] Coverage regression prevention
- [ ] Automated quality gate enforcement

This comprehensive approach ensures systematic improvement in test coverage while maintaining development velocity and code quality.
