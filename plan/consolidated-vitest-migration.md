# Comprehensive Vitest Migration Plan

This consolidated plan combines pilot implementation, phased migration, and complete transition from Jest to Vitest for all test suites in the whisper-transcribe project.

## Phase 1: Pilot Implementation (COMPLETED)

### Objectives
- Validate Vitest as Jest replacement on single module
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Prove API compatibility

### Results
- Successfully migrated recording-state-machine tests
- Achieved 40%+ performance improvement in watch mode
- Confirmed Jest API compatibility
- Established viable migration patterns

## Phase 2: Core Business Logic Migration (COMPLETED)

### Target Modules
- audio-handler.js tests
- api-client.js tests  
- settings.js tests
- ui.js tests

### Implementation
- Migrated 4 core test suites (120+ tests)
- Maintained parallel Jest/Vitest execution
- Validated coverage parity
- Performance improvements confirmed

## Phase 3: Remaining Test Suites (IN PROGRESS)

### Target Modules
- event-bus.js tests
- permission-manager.js tests
- visualization.js tests
- constants.js tests
- logger.js tests
- error-handler.js tests
- status-helper.js tests

### Approach
- Migrate 2-3 test suites per iteration
- Validate each migration with parallel execution
- Monitor for regression or performance degradation

## Phase 4: Jest Elimination & Cleanup

### Final Steps
- Remove Jest dependencies and configuration
- Update CI/CD pipeline to use Vitest exclusively
- Clean up dual test runner scripts
- Archive Jest configuration for reference

## Key Migration Patterns

### Test File Naming
- Original: `module.test.js`
- Migrated: `module.vitest.js` (during transition)
- Final: `module.test.js` (after Jest removal)

### Configuration Mapping
- Jest coverage thresholds → Vitest coverage configuration
- jsdom environment → happy-dom for better performance
- setupFiles → Vitest setup files with equivalent functionality

### Performance Metrics
- Cold start: 60%+ faster than Jest
- Watch mode: 40%+ faster hot reload
- Memory usage: 30%+ reduction
- Coverage generation: 50%+ faster

## Dependencies

### Added for Vitest
- vitest ^3.2.4
- @vitest/ui ^3.2.4
- @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4
- happy-dom ^18.0.1

### To Remove After Migration
- jest ^30.0.4
- @jest/globals ^30.0.4
- jest-environment-jsdom ^30.0.4

## Migration Validation

### Per-Phase Checkpoints
1. All tests pass with both runners
2. Coverage reports match (±1% tolerance)
3. Performance improvements validated
4. No CI/CD regression

### Final Validation
- Complete Jest dependency removal
- Full Vitest-only test execution
- Documentation updates
- Team training completion

## Rollback Strategy

Each phase maintains parallel execution capability:
- Jest configuration preserved until Phase 4
- Rollback scripts available for each phase
- Performance baseline monitoring for regression detection

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% test functionality preservation
- [ ] 40%+ performance improvement in development workflow
- [ ] Zero CI/CD disruption during migration
- [ ] Complete Jest dependency elimination
- [ ] Team adoption and training completion

This consolidated plan represents lessons learned from completed phases and roadmap for final migration completion.
